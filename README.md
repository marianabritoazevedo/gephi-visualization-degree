# Fifa World Cup 2022 - Degree Visualization

## About this repository
This repository aims to build an interactive page for viewing a network referring to Wikipedia searches related to the `2022 FIFA World Cup`.

For this, the [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) software was used, responsible for the construction and styling of the network, as well as the production of files related to the interactive page, through the `SigmaExporter` plugin of this tool.

This repository represents only a part of the final work developed in the Data Structure II discipline, done by [Mariana Azevedo](https://github.com/marianabritoazevedo), [Morsinaldo Medeiros](https://github.com/Morsinaldo) and and [Tha√≠s Medeiros](https://github.com/thaisaraujo2000). The complete work can be checked at [this link](https://github.com/marianabritoazevedo/data-structure-ii).
